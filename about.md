I grew up in China without any idea what I would like to do! I stayed in Singapore for about 10 months. Singapore is a beautiful city country. I did not spent time appreciating its beauty then because I was rushing my life with lots of stuff now I deem minor.

I have been in US for more than 16 years. Time flies!

### More Information

I like soccer, basketball. Follows Jeremy Lin's game as long as he is still active!
