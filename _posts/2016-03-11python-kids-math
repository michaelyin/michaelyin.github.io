title: Simple Python program to list all possible M&Ms
---

For my son's math home work, I write a simple Python program to list all possible M&Ms.

import itertools

def str(list):
    '''Given a list of characters, return a string'''
    length = len(list)
    str = ''
    for i in range(length):
        str = str + list[i]
    return str


# Anna has four M&Ms (two red, one yellow, and one blue), which are identical
# except for color. In how many distinct (different) orders can Anna eat her M&Ms
# if she eats them one by one
mms = ['R', 'R', 'Y', 'B', 'G', 'O']
pm = itertools.permutations(mms)

plist = []
for e in pm:
    el = e
    plist.append(el)

strlist = []
for l in plist:
    print l
    print str(l)
    strlist.append(str(l))

str_set = set(strlist)
for e in str_set:
    print e
   
print 'Number of sequences: ', len(str_set)
